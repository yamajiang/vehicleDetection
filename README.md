## Vehicle Detection using YOLO and OpenCV

- Implemented vehicle detection using **YOLO** and **OpenCV** to process video frames.
- Displays:
  - Bounding boxes around detected vehicles.
  - Labels with the vehicle type and count.
  - A real-time vehicle count per frame.
  
### Setup:
1. **Create a Python Virtual Environment (venv)**:
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```

2. **Upload a Video File**:
   - Place your video file in the appropriate directory.
